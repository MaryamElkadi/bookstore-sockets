# bookstore-sockets

The Bookstore Project is a client-server application built using Java Sockets, designed to provide an interactive online bookstore system. The system allows users to perform various operations such as browsing and searching books, managing user accounts, adding or removing books, submitting book requests, viewing request history, reviewing books, and displaying library statistics.

This project leverages socket programming to enable communication between the client and server, ensuring real-time interaction with the bookstore services.
